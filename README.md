## Introduction

SQL Injection is a common web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By injecting malicious SQL code into web forms, attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete data within the database.

This repository provides examples of SQL Injection PoC in multiple programming languages including Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Golang. Additionally, it includes scripts that automate the exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities to extract sensitive data like usernames and passwords.

## Usage

Each programming language directory contains a specific SQL Injection PoC script. You can use these scripts to understand how SQL Injection works and how to protect your applications from such attacks.
